 Desc -> takes a command-line argument N, asks you to think of a number between 0 and N-1, where N = 2^n, and always guesses the answer with n questions.
 I/P -> the Number N and then recursively ask true/false if the number is between a high and low value
 Logic -> Use Binary Search to find the number
 O/P -> Print the intermediary number and the final answer

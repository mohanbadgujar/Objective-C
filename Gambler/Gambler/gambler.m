  ----------------------------------Problem Statement - Gambler -----------------------------------------------
 
  Desc -> Simulates a gambler who start with $stake and place fair $1 bets until he/she goes broke (i.e. has no money) or reach $goal. Keeps track of the number of times he/she wins and the number of bets he/she makes. Run the experiment N times, averages the results, and prints them out.
  I/P -> $Stake, $Goal and Number of times
  Logic -> Play till the gambler is broke or has won
  O/P -> Print Number of Wins and Percentage of Win and Loss.
